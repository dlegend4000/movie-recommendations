**Movie Recommendations**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Movie recomendations Application!. Using machine learning and third party APIs this project is designed to help you find suitable movie recommendations.

**How It Works**

Our movie recommmendation application ends the struggle of figuring out what to watch next without the fear of time being wasted trying out a movie you dont like:

The user inputs the name of a movie they like. Our application uses cosine silimarities and a supervised machine learning algorithm called KNN classification in order to find the movies most similar to the one the user provided.
The top 20 most similar movies are selected. This information is then ordered downwards with the most similar movie appearing first. The movie recommmendations are displayed in an aesthetic format using a third party API for the posters and streamlit for the rest of the web application.
 
**Deployment**

We deployed our web application using streamlit

**Future Enhancements**

We are committed to continuous innovation. For the future I aim to rebuild this web application using flask, in order to incorporate features like href buttons to make the application more interactive and insightful 

**Get Involved**

We welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community. 

Thank you for checking out this project!
